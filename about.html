          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Oneway Security Services was founded by <strong>Isa</strong>, and his sister <strong>Lejla</strong>.
            Growing up in a security-focused family, we saw first-hand what good security looks like – clear communication, strong presence, and respect for people and property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we focus on understanding each site or event properly.
            Our goal is simple: provide professional security that our clients can rely on, without overcomplicating things.

          <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
          <p>
            We believe security should make people feel safer, not uncomfortable. That means guards who are:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 1.1rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">
            <li>Presentable and professional on every shift</li>
            <li>Clear and calm when dealing with incidents</li>
            <li>Respectful with tenants, customers, and staff</li>
            <li>Serious about reporting and accountability</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.6rem;">
            Whether it’s a plaza, construction site, or private event, we treat your property as if it were our own.
